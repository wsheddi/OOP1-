We used Java language to create a complete educational application. This project has helped students and teachers to gain a better usage of technology in comparison to the traditional teaching style. the teachers can evaluate the studentâ€™s level by letting the students use this application without the need for paper. also helps in setting a time for students to meet their teachers by having accounts in the system. Teachers can access their accounts and see how many students are registered to see them. In conclusion, it has devolved our knowledge of java and its usage in applications.
